                            We should give the students some bogus assignment so that we can leave and go play

                            The quotes here have to be images. There is no way they are text.

                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    A paragraph about motivation to fill out the page. Exhaustion is creeping; the hours are growing long; only week four. This goal is quickly seeming
                    more difficult that originally anticipated. But I must stay motivated. I must make it through and do the best that I can. Do not forget the end goal.
                    Never forget the end goal and you can accomplish what you want. You're hard headed, but smart. Hang in their chief. - Speech to myself by Turner Millsaps
